                Hello! I'm Yonatan Berihun, a passionate and resilient aspiring developer currently in my third year of Information Systems at Hawassa University. My journey into technology began with a challenging introduction to C++, but that initial struggle ignited a relentless drive in me.

            <blockquote>
                Instead of being discouraged, I dedicated myself to mastering the craft, quickly expanding my skills to include C, C#, Python, Dart, and Java.
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>
                This experience taught me to be a persistent, teachable, and lifelong learner who thrives on overcoming obstacles. I don't just write code; I embrace challenges and remain persistent until I achieve my goals.
